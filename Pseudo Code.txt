Read a text file as RDD
Split into words
map words to (word,1) and reduceBy(_+_) ---> X
Now Apply zipwithIndex
for loop:
	for each targetword
	Select +9,-9 words
	map this set to (word,1) and ReduceBy(_+_)
	Now map that RDD to (TargetWord,word,Count) ---> Y
	Apply JOIN on X,Y with TargetWord as KEY ---> Z
	Map Z to (word,TargetWord,Frequency)
After Loop
	ReduceBy(_+_) on Frequency

Now Repeat the above for 9 other files and Apply UNION
